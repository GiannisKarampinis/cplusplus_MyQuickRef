# Operator Overloading

### Can a member function have the object of same class?

Yes, a member function can have an object of the same class. This is commonly used in object-oriented programming to perform operations that involve multiple objects of the same class. Here's a detailed explanation and an example in C++ to illustrate this concept:

When you define a member function within a class, you can pass objects of the same class as parameters to that function. This allows the function to compare, combine, or otherwise interact with other instances of the same class. This capability is often used in operator overloading, copy constructors, and other functions where interaction between objects of the same class is required.
